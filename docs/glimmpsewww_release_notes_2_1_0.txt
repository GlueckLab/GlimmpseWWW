GLIMMPSE WWW 2.1.0 Release Notes
--------------------------------------------

Internal Changes

- Migrated entire interface to Angular.js, Jquery, and Twitter Bootstrap
  (this project replaces the deprecated GlimmpseWeb project which was
   written in Google Web Toolkit)

New Features

- Study design menus have been reordered for clarity
- Users may upload designs from the main application screen
- When the study design is incomplete, clicking the calculate button
  will show a list of incomplete screens
- After calculating results, the results table, plot, and matrices may be
  selected from the menus at the top left of the application window
- The calculate button is only visible when the design has changed and recalculation
  is required.
- The user may modify plot options without recalculating results
- When solving for sample size, users can now plot sample size by
  nominal power, variability scale or means scale

Bug Fixes

- Several stability updates which prevent inconsistencies in
  the internal study design representation

Known Issues

- We are still working on improving error messages when only a subset of 
power calculations fail.
- Extremely large sample sizes (> 100K) may lead to numerical
overflows and yield lower than expected power values, or
may fail due to invalid degrees of freedom in the underlying
F approximations
