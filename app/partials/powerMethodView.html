<h3>Power Calculation Method</h3>
<p>
    For designs including a baseline covariate, two methods are available to calculate power:
    unconditional power and quantile power. One can think of the random covariate values
    as having been sampled from a normal distribution. Thus there are many possible realizations
    of the same experiment, and each realization may have a different power. The unconditional
    power is defined as the average of the possible power values (Gatsonis and Sampson, 1989; Glueck and Muller, 2003).
    The <i>100 x vth</i> quantile power is the power value chosen so that power as small or smaller occurs
    in <i>100 x v</i> percent of all possible realizations of the experiment.
</p>

    For a detailed description of unconditional and quantile power, please see
