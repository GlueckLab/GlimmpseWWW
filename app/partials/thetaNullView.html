<h3>Null Hypotheses: $\boldsymbol{\Theta}_{0}$ Matrix</h3>
<p>
    For $\boldsymbol{\Theta} = \boldsymbol{CBU}$, the general linear hypothesis is stated as
    \[\begin{aligned}
    H_0: \boldsymbol{\Theta} = \boldsymbol{\Theta}_0.
    \end{aligned} \]
</p>
<p>
    In most cases, the $\boldsymbol{\Theta}_{0}$ matrix will contain zeros.<p></p>
    The number of rows in $\boldsymbol{\Theta}_{0}$ must equal the number of rows in $\boldsymbol{C}$,
    and the number of columns must match the number of columns in $\boldsymbol{U}$.
    To ensure conforming matrices, the dimensions of $\boldsymbol{\Theta}_{0}$
    cannot be adjusted on this screen.
</p>
<p>
    Enter your $\boldsymbol{\Theta}_{0}$ matrix below.
