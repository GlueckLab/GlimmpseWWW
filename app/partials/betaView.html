<h3>Regression Coefficients: $\boldsymbol{B}$ Matrix</h3>
<p>
    The $\boldsymbol{B}$ matrix contains regression coefficients. Specify the values you expect to
    see for these coefficients. These values may be determined from pilot data or
    previous studies. We recommend selecting values which represent scientifically
    meaningful differences. At least one of the values in the $\boldsymbol{B}$ matrix should be non-zero.
    Otherwise, power will equal the test size.
</p>
<p>
    The number of columns in $\boldsymbol{B}$ indicates the number of outcomes in your study (i.e. the
    number of columns in $\boldsymbol{Y}$). To adjust the number of outcomes in your study, change the
    column dimension in the text box above the matrix data. The number of rows in $\boldsymbol{B}$ must
    equal the number of columns in $Es(\boldsymbol{X})$, so it cannot be adjusted on this screen.
</p>

    Enter values for the regression coefficients in the matrix below.
