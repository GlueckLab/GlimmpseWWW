<h3>Covariance of Outcomes: $\boldsymbol{\Sigma}_Y$</h3>
<p>
    For each independent sampling unit, $\boldsymbol{\Sigma}_Y$ is the covariance of the
    outcomes conditional on the fixed predictors.  One can think of $\boldsymbol{\Sigma}_Y$ as the error covariance
    for each independent sampling unit in
    a model containing only the fixed predictors and excluding the Gaussian covariate.
</p>
<p>
    For univariate designs, $\boldsymbol{\Sigma}_Y$ will be a $(1\times1)$ matrix containing the
    variance of the outcome conditional on the fixed predictors.  More complex structures may be entered for
    multivariate or repeated measures designs.
    $\boldsymbol{\Sigma}_Y$ is a square, symmetric matrix with dimensions equal to the number of columns in $\boldsymbol{B}$.
</p>
<p>
Enter values for $\boldsymbol{\Sigma}_Y$ in the matrix below.
