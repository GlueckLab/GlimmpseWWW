<h3>Covariance of Outcomes: &Sigma;<sub>y</sub></h3>
<p>
    For each independent sampling unit, <b>&Sigma;</b><sub>y</sub> is the covariance of the
    outcomes conditional on the fixed predictors.  One can think of <b>&Sigma;</b><sub>y</sub> as the error covariance
    for each independent sampling unit in
    a model containing only the fixed predictors and excluding the Gaussian covariate.
</p>
<p>
    For univariate designs, <b>&Sigma;</b><sub>y</sub> will be a 1x1 matrix containing the
    variance of the outcome conditional on the fixed predictors.  More complex structures may be entered for
    multivariate or repeated measures designs.
    <b>&Sigma;</b><sub>y</sub> is a square, symmetric matrix with dimensions equal to the number of columns in <b>B</b>.
</p>
<p>
Enter values for <b>&Sigma;</b><sub>y</sub> in the matrix below.
