<h3>Covariance of Errors: $\boldsymbol{\Sigma}_e$ Matrix</h3>
<p>
    For each independent sampling unit, $\boldsymbol{\Sigma}_e$ is the covariance of the
    random errors. For univariate designs, $\boldsymbol{\Sigma}_e$ will be a $(1\times1)$ matrix containing the
    variance of the error term.  More complex structures may be entered for
    multivariate or repeated measures designs.
    Values for $\boldsymbol{\Sigma}_e$ are typically obtained from pilot data or previous studies.
</p>
<p>
    $\boldsymbol{\Sigma}_e$ is a square, symmetric matrix with dimensions equal to the number of columns in $\boldsymbol{B}$.
</p>
<p>
    Enter values for $\boldsymbol{\Sigma}_e$ in matrix below.
