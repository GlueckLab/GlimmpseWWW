<h3>Covariance of Errors: &Sigma;<sub>e</sub> Matrix</h3>
<p>
    For each independent sampling unit, <b>&Sigma;</b><sub>e</sub> is the covariance of the
    random errors. For univariate designs, <b>&Sigma;</b><sub>e</sub> will be a 1x1 matrix containing the
    variance of the error term.  More complex structures may be entered for
    multivariate or repeated measures designs.
    Values for <b>&Sigma;</b><sub>e</sub> are typically obtained from pilot data or previous studies.
</p>
<p>
    <b>&Sigma;</b><sub>e</sub> is a square, symmetric matrix with dimensions equal to the number of columns in <b>B</b>.
</p>
<p>
Enter values for <b>&Sigma;</b><sub>e</sub> in matrix below.
