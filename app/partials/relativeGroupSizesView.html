<h3>Relative Group Sizes</h3>
<p>
    Specify whether the study subgroups are of equal or unequal size.
</p>
<p>
    For equal group sizes, select a "1" in the drop-down list next to each study subgroup. This is the default study design.
</p>

<p>
For unequal group sizes, specify the ratio of the group sizes. For example, consider a design
    with an active drug group and a placebo group. If twice as many study participants receive
    the placebo, a value of "2" would be selected for the placebo group, and a value of "1"
    would be selected for the active drug group.
