<h3>Between-Participant Contrast: $\boldsymbol{C}$ Matrix</h3>
<p>
    The $\boldsymbol{C}$ matrix defines the contrasts for between-participant effects.
    The number of rows in $\boldsymbol{C}$ must be less than or equal to the number of rows in $\boldsymbol{B}$.
    The number of columns in $\boldsymbol{C}$ must equal the number of rows in $\boldsymbol{B}$.
    To ensure conforming matrices, the number of columns in $\boldsymbol{C}$ cannot be adjusted on this screen.
</p>
<p>
    Enter your between-participant contrast matrix below.
