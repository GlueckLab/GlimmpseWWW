<h3>Between-Participant Contrast: $\boldsymbol{C}$ Matrix</h3>
<p>
    The $\boldsymbol{C}$ matrix defines the contrasts for between-participant effects. The number of rows in the $\boldsymbol{C}$
    matrix is at most one fewer than the number of rows in $Es(\boldsymbol{X})$. The number of columns in $\boldsymbol{C}$ must equal
    the number of columns in $\boldsymbol{B}$. To ensure conforming matrices, the number of columns of $\boldsymbol{C}$
    cannot be adjusted on this screen.
</p>
<p>
    Enter your between-subject contrast matrix below.
