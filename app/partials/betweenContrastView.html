<h3>Between-Participant Contrast: C Matrix</h3>
<p>
    The <b>C</b> matrix defines the contrasts for between-participant effects. The number of rows in the <b>C</b>
    matrix is at most one fewer than the number of rows in Es(<b>X</b>). The number of columns in <b>C</b> must equal
    the number of columns in <b>B</b>. To ensure conforming matrices, the number of columns of <b>C</b>
    cannot be adjusted on this screen.
</p>
<p>
    Enter your between-subject contrast matrix below.
