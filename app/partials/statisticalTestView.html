<h3> Statistical Tests </h3>
<p>
    Select the statistical tests to include in your calculations. For study designs with a
    single outcome, power is the same regardless of the test selected.
    Note that only the Hotelling-Lawley Trace and the Univariate Approach to Repeated
    Measures are supported for designs which include a baseline covariate.
