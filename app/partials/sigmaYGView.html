<h3>Covariance of Outcomes with Covariate: $\boldsymbol{\Sigma}_{Yg}$ Matrix</h3>
<p>
    When controlling for a covariate, power increases if the covariate explains some
    portion of the variance in the outcome. The $\boldsymbol{\Sigma}_{Yg}$ matrix defines the strength of
    the association between the covariate and the outcomes. For univariate designs,
    $\boldsymbol{\Sigma}_{Yg}$ will be a $(1\times1)$ matrix containing the covariance between the
    outcome and the covariate. For multivariate and repeated measures designs, the
    matrix will be $(p\times1)$, where $p$ is the number of outcomes, and each row contains the
    covariance between the covariate and the corresponding outcome.

    Enter values for $\boldsymbol{\Sigma}_{Yg}$ in matrix below.
