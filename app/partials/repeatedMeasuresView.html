<h3>
    Repeated Measures
</h3>

<p>
    Repeated measures are present when a response variable is measured on each research participant on two or more occasions or under two or more conditions.
</p>

<p>
    If the study includes repeated measurements, click “Add repeated measures” and follow the prompts. The text entered in the "Units" text box indicates the dimension over which measures were taken (ex. time, days, locations, etc.). The choice of "Type" indicates whether the repeated measures are numeric (ex. time), ordinal (ex. 1st, 2nd, 3rd), or categorical (ex. arm, leg, hand).
</p>

<p>
    You may specify up to 3 levels of repeated measures.
