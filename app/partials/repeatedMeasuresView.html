<h3>Repeated Measures</h3>

<p>
    GLIMMPSE allows you to define within-participant factors, specified as repeated measures.
    Repeated measures are present when a response variable is measured on each independent
    sampling unit on two or more occasions or under two or more conditions.
    The values of the repeated measures (that is, the levels of the within-participant factors)
    distinguish the occasions or conditions.
</p>

<p>
    If the study includes repeated measurements, click "Add Repeated Measures" and follow
    the prompts. The text entered in the "Dimension" text box indicates the dimension over
    which measures were taken (e.g. time, days, locations, etc.). The choice of "Type"
    indicates whether the repeated measures are numeric (e.g. time), ordinal (e.g. 1st,
    2nd, 3rd), or categorical (e.g. arm, leg, hand).
</p>

<p>
    You may specify up to 3 repeated measures.
