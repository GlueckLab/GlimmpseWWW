    <h3>Scale Factors for Regression Coefficients</h3>
    <p>
        In power analysis, it is not possible to know the exact values of regression coefficients
        before the experiment is observed. Scale factors allow you to consider alternative values
        for the regression coefficients by scaling the $\boldsymbol{B}$ matrix. For example, entering the scale
        factors 0.5, 1, and 2 would compute power for the $\boldsymbol{B}$ matrix divided by 2,
        the $\boldsymbol{B}$ as entered, and the $\boldsymbol{B}$ matrix multiplied by 2.

    <h3>Scale Factors for Means</h3>
    <p>
        In power analysis, it is not possible to know the exact values of means
        before the experiment is observed. Scale factors allow you to consider alternative values
        for the means by scaling the values entered on the previous screen. For example, entering the scale
        factors 0.5, 1, and 2 would compute power for the the mean values divided by 2,
        the mean values as specified, and the mean values multiplied by 2.
