<h3>Scale Factors for Regression Coefficients</h3>
<p>
    In power analysis, it is not possible to know the exact values of regression coefficients before the experiment is observed. Scale factors allow you to consider alternative values for the regression coefficients by scaling the B matrix. For example, entering the scale factors 0.5, 1, and 2 would compute power for the B matrix divided by 2, the B as entered, and the B matrix multiplied by 2.
