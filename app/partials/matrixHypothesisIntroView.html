<h3>Hypothesis as Contrast Matrices: Introduction</h3>

<p>
    In this section, you can define the hypothesis of interest for your study.
    The hypothesis is defined by specifying contrasts for between-participant
    factors ($\boldsymbol{C}$ matrix) and for within-participant factors ($\boldsymbol{U}$ matrix).
</p>
<p>
    You may also select one or more statistical tests, and specify the Type I error rate.
</p>
<p>
    Lastly, you will define the matrix of values for your null hypothesis.
</p>
