<h3>Scale Factors for Covariance</h3>
<p>
    Changes in variability can dramatically affect power. Scale factors allow you to compute power for alternative covariance values by scaling Σe. For example, entering the scale factors 0.5, 1, and 2 would compute power for Σe divided by 2, Σe matrix as entered, and Σe matrix multiplied by 2.
