    <h3>Scale Factors for Covariance</h3>
    <p>
        Changes in variability can dramatically affect power. Scale factors allow you to
        compute power for alternative covariance values by scaling $\boldsymbol{\Sigma}_e$. For example,
        entering the scale factors 0.5, 1, and 2 would compute power for $\boldsymbol{\Sigma}_e$ divided by 2,
        $\boldsymbol{\Sigma}_e$ matrix as entered, and $\boldsymbol{\Sigma}_e$ matrix multiplied by 2.

    <h3>Scale Factors for Variability</h3>
    <p>
        On the previous screens, you entered standard deviations and correlations.
        Glimmpse will use these values to calculate a covariance matrix which describes the
        overall variability in the design.
    </p>
    <p>
        Changes in variability can dramatically affect power and sample size results.
        It is not possible to know the variability until the experiment is observed.
        Scale factors allow you to consider alternative values for variability by scaling
        the calculated covariance matrix. For example, entering the scale factors 0.5, 1,
        and 2 would compute power for the covariance matrix divided by 2,
        the covariance matrix as entered, and the covariance matrix multiplied by 2.
