<h3>The Design Essence Matrix</h3>
<p>
In the general linear model, Y = XB + E, the X matrix contains predictor and covariate information.
For power analysis, please specify a design essence matrix, Es(X). The Es(X) matrix contains one
and only one copy of each unique row in the full design matrix. This allows separation of the
study design information from overall and relative sample size.
</p>
<p>
Enter the Es(X) matrix below. To change the row dimension of the matrix, enter the updated number
of rows in the left-most textbox above the matrix data. To change the column dimension, enter the
desired number of columns in the right-most textbox above the matrix data. Please use a full rank
coding for this matrix.
</p>
