<h3>  Within Participant Variability
</h3>

<p>
    For a given research participant, responses vary across response variables and across repeated measurements .
    The amount of variability can dramatically impact power and sample size. Click on each of the tabs below to describe the varibility
    you expect to observe for the response variables and each within-participant factor.

            Structured Correlation: The Linear Exponential Auto-Regressive Model (LEAR, Simpson et al., 2010)
        </h3>
        <p>
            The LEAR model describes correlation which monotonely decreases with distance between repeated measurements.
            The model has two correlation parameters, the base correlation and the decay rate. The base correlation
            describes the correlation between measurements taken 1 unit apart. The decay rate describes the rate of
            decrease in the base correlation as the distance or time between repeated measurements increases.
            Our experience with biological and behavioral data lead us to suggest using decay values between 0.05 and 0.5.
