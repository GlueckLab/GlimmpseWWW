<h3>  Within Participant Variability
</h3>

<p>
    For a given research participant, responses vary across response variables and across repeated measurements . The amount of variability can dramatically impact power and sample size. Click on each of the tabs below to describe the varibility you expect to observe for the response variables and each within-particpant factor.
