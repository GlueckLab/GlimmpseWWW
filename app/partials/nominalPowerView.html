<h3>Power Values</h3>
<p>
Enter the desired power values in the list box below. Power values are numbers between 0 and 1.
Higher values correspond to a greater likelihood of rejecting the null hypothesis.
Common values are 0.8 or 0.9, although 0.9 or higher is usually preferred.
</p>

Type each value into the list box and click "enter" on your keyboard. To remove an item, click the "x" next to the item.
