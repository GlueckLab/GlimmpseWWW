<h3>Would you like to solve for power or sample size? </h3>
<p>
To begin your calculation, please indicate whether you would like to solve for power or total sample size.
</p>
<p>
If you have a rough idea of the number of research participants you will be able to recruit, then solving
for power may be more beneficial.
</p>
<p>
If you have fewer restrictions on recruitment and would like to ensure a well-powered study,
then solving for sample size is likely to be more useful.
