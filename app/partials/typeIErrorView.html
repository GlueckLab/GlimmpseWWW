<h3>Type I Error Rates</h3>
<p>
    A Type I error occurs when a scientist declares a difference when none is actually present.
    The Type I error rate is the probability of a Type I error occurring, and is often referred to as &alpha; (alpha).
    Type I error rates range from 0 to 1. The most commonly used values are 0.01, 0.05, and 0.1.
