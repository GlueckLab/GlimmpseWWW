<h3>Type I Error Values</h3>
<p>
    A Type I error occurs when a scientist declares a difference when none is actually present.
    The Type I error rate is the probability of a Type I error occurring, and is often referred to as &alpha;.
    Type I error rates range from 0 to 1. The most commonly used values are 0.01, 0.05, and 0.1.

    Type each value into the list box and click "enter" on your keyboard. To remove an item, click the "x" next to the item.
