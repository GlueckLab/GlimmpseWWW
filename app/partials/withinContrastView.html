<h3>Within-Subject Contrast: $\boldsymbol{U}$ Matrix</h3>
<p>
    The $\boldsymbol{U}$ matrix defines the contrasts for within-subject effects. The matrix
    is necessary for multivariate and repeated measures designs. The number of
    rows in $\boldsymbol{U}$ must equal the number of columns in $\boldsymbol{B}$. To ensure conforming matrices,
    the row dimension of $\boldsymbol{U}$ cannot be adjusted on this screen.

</p>
<p>
    Enter your within-subject contrast matrix below.

<ng-resizable-matrix ng-model="withinContrastMatrix" rowresizable='false' columnresizable='true'
