<h3>Within-Subject Contrast: U Matrix</h3>
<p>
    The U matrix defines the contrasts for within-subject effects. The matrix
    is necessary for multivariate and repeated measures designs. The number of
    rows in U must equal the number of columns in B. To ensure conforming matrices,
    the row dimension of U cannot be adjusted on this screen.

    Enter your within-subject contrast matrix below.
