<h3>Means</h3>

<p>
    The table below shows the mean values for each outcome within each study subgroup. The study subgroups are listed along the left hand side of the table, and the outcomes are listed across the top.
</p>

<p>
    Enter the mean values you expect to observe for each outcome within each study subgroup. The table should contain at least one value that is non-zero. Also, at least two subgroups should have means which differ by a scientifically meaningful amount.
</p>
