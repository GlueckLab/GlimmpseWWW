<h3>Model: Introduction</h3>

<p>
    A model is used to examine relationships between variables in the study design.
    When defining the model, the investigator must consider several questions.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <b>Clustering</b>: Are the participants organized into groups (geographic regions, schools, etc.)
        which induce correlation?
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Predictors and Groups</b>: What factors distinguish independent participants or groups of participants?
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Covariates</b>: Is there an additional variable which is not of scientific
        interest, but still explains some of the variability in the outcome?
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Responses</b>: What outcomes are being measured in the study?
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Repeated Measures</b>: Are the outcomes observed once, at multiple
        times, or under multiple conditions?
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Relative group sizes</b>: Are there equal or unequal numbers of participants in
        each subgroup in the study?
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Smallest group size</b>: If calculating power, how many independent participants or
        groups of participants will be recruited in each study subgroup?
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    In this section, you may define each component of the model for your design.
