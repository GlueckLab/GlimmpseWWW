    Means: Introduction
</h3>
<p>
    In power analysis, it is necessary to choose mean values for the outcomes
    before running the study. The means are often obtained from published results
    or pilot data.  Larger mean differences are easier to detect, and so have
    greater power.  To detect smaller differences, the investigator will typically
    need a larger sample size.
</p>
<p>
    To detect a difference between the groups, at least two subgroups
    should have means which differ by a scientifically meaningful amount.
    For example, in a study of cholesterol-lowering medication, we would
    expect the mean cholesterol level in the active drug group to be
    lower than the placebo group.
