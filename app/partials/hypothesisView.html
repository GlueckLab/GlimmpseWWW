<h3>Hypotheses</h3>

<p>
    Power and sample size calculations are typically based on the primary study hypothesis. GLIMMPSE will generate several possible hypotheses based on your study design. Click the forward arrow to continue.
</p>

<p>
    The options below show the hypotheses which are available for the current study design. Select the hypothesis which most closely resembles your primary study hypothesis. This hypothesis will be used to determine power for your study.

<p>
    To specify a hypothesis, select the radio button matching the type of hypothesis you wish to test, and then enter the requested details. Note that trends within an interaction hypothesis may be specified by selecting the "Interaction" button. For more information about the type of hypothesis, click the magnifying glass icon.
